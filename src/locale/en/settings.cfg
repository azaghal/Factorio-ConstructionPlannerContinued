[mod-setting-description]
constructionPlanner-auto-approve=When enabled, newly-built and newly-stamped ghosts will start out as approved instead of unapproved.  This setting can also be toggled in-game by toolbar shortcut or by hotkey (__CONTROL__toggle-auto-approve__)
construction-approvals-indicator-size=Set the size of approval indicators (tick-boxes shown on top of ghost entities). Changing the size of approval indicators in an existing save game might result in a slight stutter as the indicators are updated across all surfaces/planets.
