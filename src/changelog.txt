Version: 1.1.0
Date: 2022-07-19
  Features:
    - Removal of unapproved ghosts using deconstruction planner can now be undone using standard game controls (Control + Z).
    - Removal of unapproved ghosts using cut-and-paste tool can now be undone using standard game controls (Control + Z).
  Bugfixes:
    - Ignore ghost entitites that are marked as non-selectable. Fixes phantom ghosts when used with Tapeline mod. Permanent tapelines would leave "phantom" ghosts otherwise.

    - Fixed accidental approvals when placing ghosts by quickly dragging across the screen.
