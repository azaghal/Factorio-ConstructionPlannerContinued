Source repository for the Factorio mod Construction Planner

## Description

Construction Planner is a mod for the video game [Factorio](https://factorio.com/).  It changes the behavior of how ghost entities are built to give the player more control over planning and building their factory.  When a ghost entity is placed by hand or by blueprint, construction bots will no longer be automatically dispatched to build it; instead, the player must use the Construction Planner tool to approve construction of the ghost, and only then will the bots be dispatched.

Benefits of using Construction Planner:
- Plan an entire factory in advance, without committing to building it all right away
- Avoid bot dispatch chaos when a blueprint is accidentally stamped in the wrong place and needs to be redone
- Strategically approve turret/wall ghosts to prioritize building defenses in key locations first
